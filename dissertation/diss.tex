\chapter{Introduction}
%\outline{0}{Introduction}
    This dissertation introduces kambpf, a flexible, low-overhead function-call tracing system for the Linux kernel. Compared to the tracing capabilities currently in the Linux kernel, kambpf has a lower overhead and the added flexibility instrumenting any subset of call sites of a given function. Compared to the kamprobes project on which it builds upon, kambpf provides the flexibility of being programmable with eBPF, and an interface from the user space. 

    The kambpf system is available as a loadable kernel module with its functionality exported to the user space via a simple to use C library.

    \section{Motivation}
        %There is a class of bugs and performance issues that are impractical or impossible to be reproduced by a developer in a testing environment
        The behaviour and performance of a computer system is influenced by the software components it runs, the hardware on which it runs, how the system is configured, and the data it processes. It is thus inevitable that problems which were not be observed, and are difficult to reproduce in development and testing occur in production. In such cases it is often up to the system integrator to analyse the performance issues.\cite{DTrace2004}
        
        Instrumenting operating system's kernel, because it is the interface through which all processes interact with each other and with the hardware, is a great way to observe and analyse the behaviour of all processes running on the system. By instrumenting the kernel the system integrator can find performance bottlenecks and processes that are misbehaving. In particular, dynamic tracing is a great way to instrument long-running software such as the kernel, because it doesn't require recompiling or restarting to enable and disable the instrumentation.\cite{DynamicPI1994}
