01.11.2019: 
- installed llvm (v6), as suggested in linux/samples/bpf
- created a pilot module that runs ebpf program. 
	- challanges: 
		- can I run two probes at once, how can I know
		- do I need to disable interrupts
		- which function runs the eBPF program, there is no documentation
		- how to do reference counting
